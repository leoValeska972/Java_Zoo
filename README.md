# Java_Zoo

This repository contains my learning project from the [**Amazon Junior Software Developer**](https://www.coursera.org/programs/eightfold-pliic/professional-certificates/amazon-junior-software-developer) certification courses on Coursera. The project showcases my understanding and practical application of core and advanced Java programming concepts, including object-oriented design, interfaces, inheritance, and serialization.

## Courses

This project is based on the following Coursera courses:

- [**Introduction to Software Development**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-software-development)
- [**Programming with Java**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-software-development)

## Project Overview

This project simulates a simple zoo environment featuring various animals such as Tiger, Dolphin, and Penguin. Through this project, I applied important Java concepts to build a modular, maintainable, and interactive program.

Key features include:
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Used abstract classes and interfaces to define animal behaviors and properties.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Created specific animal classes extending a base `Animal` class and implementing multiple interfaces like `Eat`, `Walk`, and `Swim`.
- **Serialization & File I/O:** Enabled saving and loading animal objects to and from files, demonstrating data persistence.
- **Interactive Menu:** Developed a user-friendly console menu to display animal behaviors, save data to files, and read saved data back.

## What I Learned

- How to design and implement abstract classes and interfaces in Java for clean and reusable code.
- The role of interfaces in achieving multiple inheritance and enforcing contracts on classes.
- Implementing serialization by making classes implement `Serializable`, overriding `toString()`, and managing file input/output streams.
- Integrating multiple programming concepts to build a fully functional interactive program.
- Handling program state persistence through reading and writing serialized data files.

## Notes

- IDE-specific files (`.iml`, `.idea`) and build output directories are excluded from version control and should be generated/configured locally.
- The project assumes familiarity with standard Java project setup and execution.

## Usage

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE and run the main class to start the interactive console application.
